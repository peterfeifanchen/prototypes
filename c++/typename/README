Typename in C++ is used to specify that the identifier following it is a type. This
disambiguates between:

template<class T> Class myClass{
	typename T::SubType * ptr;
	...
};

and

template<class T> Class myClass{
	T::SubType * ptr;
	...
};

In the former, ptr is a type T::SubType. In the latter, it is a multiplication 
of T::SubType with ptr.
