SFINAE - substituion failure is not an error is a compile time metaprogramming
technique. When a substitution error occurs during compile time, it will not
produce an error, but simply soldier on.

NOTE: sfinae can only be applied on function specialization. For example, you 
cannot use it to selectively create compile time errors for member variables of
a class (so that some instances of the class has some member variable while others
do not). Doing that using SFINAE is show in the sfinae.cpp.
