Segment trees are a full binary tree of 2n-1 nodes for n node array. Each parent
node is the f() of the ranges of its leaf nodes. The leaf of the tree are the 
array nodes. The f() can be sum(), max(), min(), xor() or any operation that wants
to search a range between l and r. 

Like heaps and other trees, segment trees can be implemented as an array at the cost
of extra memory for empty nodes. Each child is at 2*i+1 and 2*i+2 and parent is at
(i-1)/2. A segment tree is full if the number of elements were a power of 2.

A segment tree is able to both query a range and update a range in O(LogN) time.

Compared to BIT trees which takes N nodes of memory, segment tress takes the
nearest power of 2 of 2*N-1 in memory.
