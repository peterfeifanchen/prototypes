Golang mock is a package that allows you to mock methods of an interface.

1) mockgen to generate mock code for the interface you hope to mock
2) create gomock.Controller (which takes in testing.T)
3) EXPECT() to setup expectations and return values
4) Finish() to assert expectations (not idempotent, asserts that expected
	 calls were made, does not assert correctness of the output of mock)
