Greatest Common Divisor

Euclid algorithm is where you take the remainder of the larger number divided by the
smaller number. Then successively doing that until the remainder reaches 0. The last
divisor is then the GCD.

Given two numbers a and b:

   a % b = n1b + a1   (a1 < b)

If a1 == 0 then obviously b is the greatest common divisor of a and b.

Inductively if a1 > 0 then:

   b % a1 = n2a1 + b2

If b2 == 0 then a1 is a multiple of b and thus a % b = n1b + n2a1 == 0. 
This means that when the remainder is 0, the divisor is a divisor of a and b.

To prove that this is the greatest divisor, we assume a = qb + r (a>b) and the
greatest common divisor is g

Lemma1: gcd(a,b) == gcd(b,r). If this is true, then
gcd(a,b) == gcd(b,r) == ... = gcd( g, 0 ) == g 

Proof: a = qb + r => r = a - qb = ng - mg = (n-m)g. Since a>b, then n-m > 0. 
This means that r is divisible by gcd(a,b). This means that the gcd(b,r) is at least
as large as g, the gcd(a,b). 

   gcd(a,b) <= gcd(b,r)

Separately, if gcd(b,r) is divisible by b and r, then a = qb + r must also be
divisible by gcd(b,r). This means
   gcd(a,b) >= gcd(b,r)

Thus, gcd(a,b) == gcd(b,r)

Therefore, the first remainder operation that gives you 0, is the largest
divisor that could be divided by a and b.
