References vs. pointers

1) A pointer can be re-assigned, a reference cannot be re-bound
2) A pointer points to a memory location, a reference is a memory location
3) No NULL for references, it must refer to something. As a member of a class, it
   must be initialized in the constructor initializer list. Likewise, it may be
   safer, as a reference does not need to be tested against NULL
4) . vs. -> for access
