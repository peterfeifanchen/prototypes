RAII is a programming pattern where you use the automatic destructor call on leaving a 
scope to safely release acquired resources. In this the resource is acquired at 
instantiation in the constructor. Hence this is called resource acquisition is 
instantiation.

This guards unexpected errors or exceptions from being thrown that would end up stranding
the clean up of some resource. Otherwise, to replicate the same behavior, you would have 
to have complicated goto fail control routines to cleanup allocated resources should some
failure occur during a complicated routine.
