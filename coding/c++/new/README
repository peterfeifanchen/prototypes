New/Delete vs. Malloc/Free
====================================================================================
New and Delete would call the constructors and destructors. 
Malloc/Free are C constructs and would not.

Always remember to free for malloc and delete for new. 

Placement New
====================================================================================
If the memory has already been allocated, you can call new with that specific
memory location:
   
   Object* myObject = new (buffer) Object(...);

And to delete it, you have to explicitly call its destructor and then free():

   myObject::~myObject();
   free( buffer );

Operator New
====================================================================================
New is a keyword of C++ and its behavior cannot be changed (e.g., allocate memory,
call constructor). However to allocate memory, it calls the new operator which has
the signature:

   void* operator new( size_t size )

This new operator can actually be overriden with your own custom allocator.
