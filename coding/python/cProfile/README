cProfile provides a per-function call breakdown of total time spent and
cumulative time (all functions called by the function) in a function. A python
script can be profiled by:

   python -m cProfile -o [output_file] -s [sort_order] python.script

The output file can then be read by:

   import pstats
   p = pstats.Stat( output_file )
   p.strip_dirs().sort_stats( [PARAM] ).print_stats()

These methods may be chained together. Others can be found in the reference manual,
but some highlights in addition to the ones above include:

   print_callers
   print_callees
   add
