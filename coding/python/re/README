Regex Expressions in Python
===========================

re.compile( regex, flags ):
   returns a compiled regex object, if regex has an error, it throws re.error

re.findall( regex, string, flags ):
   returns all non-overlapping matches as a list of tuples where each tuple is a
   sequence of match groups.

re.finditer( regex, string, flags ):
   returns an iterator of match objects


Match Object
   A python match object, it contains group() and groups()
   group():
      the complete match to the regex
   groups( n=0 ):
      a tuple of capture groups

Regex Expression

NOTE: remember to append r'' to the regex string

()      Capture group
(?:)    Capture group with no capture (still a group of terms, won't show up in
        MatchObject.groups() but will show up in MatchObject.group()
(?<=)   Non-capture group, look-behind match. (?<=abc)def will match def and then
        emit output only if the previous characters were abc with def ending up in
        the capture group output
[]      Set of items
{n,m}   Number of repeated items {,m} for at most and {n,} for at least

Flags
